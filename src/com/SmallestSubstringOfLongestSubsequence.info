FOR A STRING "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"

This program finds the length of smallest substring carrying maximum subsequence characters.

Example:

For Input:
ABCDEFMNOPQRSTGHRFUV
Number of subsequence possible in race
ABCDEFMNOPQRSTGH (8 sequenced characters,  length 16)
MNOPQRSTGHRFUV (10 sequenced characters,  length 14)
RF (10 sequenced characters,  length 14)

So the output of this should be 14

Similarly for the below input:
ABCJKDELMNBC
Number of subsequence possible in race:
ABCJKDE (5 sequenced characters,  length 7)
JKDELMN (5 sequenced characters,  length 7)
BC (2 sequenced characters,  length 2)

So the output of this should be 7
